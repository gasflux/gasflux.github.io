GasFlux is a forthcoming python package for analysis of gas concentration and wind data to produce emissions fluxes.

The primary focus is on site-level quantification of methane emissions from concentrated industry such as natural gas and landfills and of quantification of volcanic gas sources; other use-cases such as ecosystems and agriculture will be developed as the project matures.

The basic methodologies will be applicable to many diverse situations where gas emissions are being quantified in the open atmosphere.

The project has its roots in the mass-balance method developed by [Grant Allen]'s group at Manchester University for use on drone and manned aircraft platforms since 2012 and development of the package is currently led by [Jamie McQuilkin].

A beta version of the project is available to interested testers - please email [Jamie](mailto:jamie.mcquilkin@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk) for more information.
