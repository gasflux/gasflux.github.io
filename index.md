    "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.‚Äù

GasFlux is a forthcoming python package that will help measurement scientists to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and provide data to those who can mitigate them.

## Purpose
The project has two aims:
1. Provide software to produce emissions fluxes from input data in a way that is accessible, reproducible, transparent and allows for quantification of uncertainty
2. Provide a clearinghouse website for best practice in the main techniques for measuring gas fluxes

The primary focus is on site-level quantification of greenhouse gas emissions (especially methane) from concentrated industry such as oil and gas, landfills and intensive agriculture.

The basic methodologies will be applicable to many diverse situations where gas emissions are being quantified in the open atmosphere, such as volcanic emissions. Methods for more diffuse emissions such as those from ecosystems and extensive agriculture will be developed as the project matures.

## Background

The project has its roots in the mass-balance method developed by [Grant Allen]'s group at Manchester University for use on drone and manned aircraft platforms since 2012 and development of the package is currently led by [Jamie McQuilkin].

## Beta

A beta version of the project is available to those doing measurements or who want to help with coding - please email [Jamie](mailto:jamie.mcquilkin@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk) for more information. An example of data visualisations from the package can be found [here](graphics_display).
